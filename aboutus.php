                    The Tire Store was founded in 1978. Current owners Dave 
                    and Nick purchased the business in 1989 and have been running
                     the operation since. There are three The Tire Store locations 
                     today, two of which have been in the same spot for the last 30 
                     years. The first location is at 43923 N. Sierra Highway Lancaster,
                      California. The second is at 21011 Santa Barbra Drive Tehachapi, CA.
                       The third shop is at 1816 Rosamond Blvd. Rosamond, CA.
                    Itâ€™s our mission to get customers in and out of the shop as quickly as 
                    possible, while keeping prices as low as possible. Contact us online for more
                     information. Prices are born at The Tire Store, but they are raised elsewhere!

                     and Palmdale, California have been receiving great automotive service. Now, we offer a ti
